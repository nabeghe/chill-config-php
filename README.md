# Chill Config for PHP

> Where carefree meets calm, and chill thrives in your PHP configuration.

Here's a simple library that helps you set up your projectâ€™s configuration.
You pass in your options as an array, and then dynamically access them through object fields, methods or indexes.
You can also define default values in a custom config class.
Plus, you can organize different parts of your config as containers in custom classes and access those config options via static methods whenever you need them.
This makes the default values load lazily.

## ðŸ«¡ Usage

### ðŸš€ Installation

```bash
